# Pirates-of-the-Carribean-song-in-buzzer-
This file contains the code to play the "Pirates of the Caribbean" Theme Song on a Arduino via a Buzzer

## ðŸ’» Local testing

1. Download `Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_-_Theme_Song.ino`

2. Connect `Pin 10` of the Arduino to the `positive side` of a buzzer or a microphone

3. Connect any `resistor` (220 ohms for example) to the `negative side` of a buzzer and to the `ground pin` of the Arduino

4. Upload the sketch and enjoy!


ðŸš€Happy engineering and designing!

1. You can remove the paper seal on the buzzer to make it sound better .

2. `songSpeed` and `wait` are converted to `float` type .

3. `noTone` is used to handle malperformance of some Arduinos 

4. Better coding style, format, variable names...
